# Streamlit Tutorial with Sublime Text
# Introduction
This README provides a quick tutorial on how to use Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web apps, with Sublime Text, a popular text editor. Streamlit allows you to build web applications directly from Python scripts, making it easy to create data-driven apps without needing to learn web development languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

# Installation
Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python.org.

# Install Streamlit:
 Install Streamlit using pip, Python's package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

# Copy code
pip install streamlit

# Install Sublime Text: 
Download and install Sublime Text from the official website: Sublime Text.

# Getting Started
Create a Streamlit Script: Open Sublime Text and create a new Python script (e.g., app.py).

Write Your Application: Write your Streamlit application in the Python script. Here's a simple example to get you started:

import streamlit as st

st.title('My First Streamlit App')
st.write('Hello, Streamlit!')

# python
Copy code

import streamlit as st

st.title('My First Streamlit App')

st.write('Hello, Streamlit!')

# Run Your Application: 
Save the Python script and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing your script and run the following command:


Copy code

streamlit run app.py

This command will start a local web server and open your default web browser to display your Streamlit app.

# Interact with Your App: 
You can interact with your Streamlit app in the web browser. Streamlit automatically updates the app in real-time as you modify your Python script.

# Additional Resources
